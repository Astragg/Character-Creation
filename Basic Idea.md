# Ghost of Tsushima
Based off the plot of **GOT** but instead of running through Jin Sakai's story you run through a story of a smaller towns army troops that's been wiped out, The idea is to make the main pc fight their way through feudal Japan to finally put and end to the Mongols, In this version magic is ancestry or wished upon from the gods taking a gods contract and they'll grant you magic.
